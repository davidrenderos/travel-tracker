# CP1404 Assignment 2: Travel Tracker 2.0 by DAVID RENDEROS

## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
- This assessment took roughly 30 hours to complete.

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
- I am impressed with improvements I have made with code quality and being able to understand coding issue a lot easier,
making me a more confident coder.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
- Time management, as I could have prepared more accordingly, moving houses and getting an extra job in week 11. This 
forced me to work a lot hard over a shorter period of time, sacrificing commenting, and small expectations of the code.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
- Tackling coding constructs step-by-step made sure I did not feel overwhelmed with sections of the assignment, mainly 
the introduction of Classes and Inheritance.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
- For part 1, i write a lot of my code in my own words, which really simplified the process. Again, I believe if I had 
implemented this into part 2, I could have completed a higher level of code quality.

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
- Being external, a lot of what i learnt with classes came from working in my Sandbox with Class problems, alike that 
presented in the practicals. In past attempts, the up hill battle was learning the importance of single use functions,
so I spent a lot of time writing them out in my own words.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
- Some main challenges was studying externally and attempting this class again. With study being online, i felt a lot 
more excluded from the community at IT@JCU. Although 'outside' help is not approved, I approached friends from QUT for 
tips, which helped me socialise during these times. Also, meditating and forgetting about my assignment, helped me come 
back with clarity, and allowed me to tackle obstacles with my code a lot more efficiently.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
- It took this assignment for me to truly grasp the correct use of Class. With use of classes, the modularity is what 
stood out most, as breaking parts of my first assignment down showed what happens within the code.
